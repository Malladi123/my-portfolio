      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm Rakesh, a passionate UI/UX developer with a strong focus on internationalization and localization.
        I blend creative problem-solving with technical precisionâ€”whether I'm refining web interfaces or customizing my Tata Punch for aesthetic harmony.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe in user-centric design, clean code, and thoughtful iteration. My work reflects a balance of form and function.
      </p>
    </section>
